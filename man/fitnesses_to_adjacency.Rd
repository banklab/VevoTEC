\title{Create an adjacency matrix from a dataframe of fitnesses}
\usage{
fitnesses_to_adjacency(input_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A data frame with columns `ID` and `fitness`, e.g. from `parse_fitness_table()`.}
}
\value{
A square adjacency matrix (`matrix`) with row and column names corresponding to state IDs.
Entries are `1` for fitness-increasing transitions, `0` otherwise.
}
\description{
Builds a directed adjacency matrix of fitness-increasing transitions between ecological states.
Two states are connected if they differ by one locus (Hamming distance = 1),
with edges directed from lower to higher fitness.
}
\examples{
data <- data.frame(
  ID = c("(00)", "(01)", "(11)"),
  fitness = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
)
